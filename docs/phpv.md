phpv is a Providence provisioning utility for managing [PHP][] versions.
Providence installs phpv to /usr/local/bin/phpv and uses it during provisioning
to install and configure PHP. You can invoke it from the command line after
provisioning to install other versions of PHP or switch between versions. Run
`phpv -h` for help and usage information.
